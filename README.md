# Travelling-Salesman-Routing-Problem
Efficient Method of Solving Travelling Salesman Routing Problem in Tourism

This project solves an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited. Its goal is to keep both the travel costs and the distance travelled to minimum using Dijkstra algorithm and MST.
